An inverse problem is a problem where some part of the mathematical model is missing. To compensate for the missing information, some measurements that represent the systemâ€™s response are given at certain locations in space and points in time. The goal is to identify the missing parameters in the mathematical model of the system.

This repo is focusing on the optimization code of a lumerical simulation using the FDTD Method. Lumerical is a part of Ansys Optics suite. This software is used to design or simulate optics components.

## Optimization Method

This optimization is based on a lumerical example using a Python API. The example is here : https://optics.ansys.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042800573-Inverse-Design-of-Grating-Coupler-2D
